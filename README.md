# page.bcmp

bcmp is a tool to extract program features generated by LLVM -stats and compare them. The project is currently under development â€” once finished this page will be updated to contain the tool, along with an interface that will take user input, extract the same features and show a detailed comparison with the existing benchmarks. There's a gallery with some images of an alpha version.
